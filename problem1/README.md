# Visiter Recommendation System(Problem 1)

- First we explored the existing given dataset and explored it.
- In vstr.ipynb and extr.ipynb we analysed the given data. 
- It felt like some required attributes are missing so we created custom dummy data.
- Dummy data is analysed in R.ipynb
- stall2.csv and visiter.csv are our custom data

## Proposed machine learing algorithm
- We proposed retrieval model(https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders/examples/basic_retrieval).

## Model is incomplete
